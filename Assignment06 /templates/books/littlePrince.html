  <h2>The Little Prince</h2>
  <h4>by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry,  Richard Howard (Translator)</h4>
  <p>Moral allegory and spiritual autobiography, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the French language. With a timeless charm it tells the story of a little boy who leaves the safety of his own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the vagaries of adult behaviour through a series of extraordinary encounters. His personal odyssey culminates in a voyage to Earth and further adventures.</p>
